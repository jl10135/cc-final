final project for creative coding f22

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
1. volume slider is not actually indicative of volume, but the reactivity of the visualizer. slight volume warning for certain tracks
2. there are limitations with skimming through the songs due to usage of html elements--they cannot update as quickly and so it's best to just let the song run its course
